this is the simplified file hierachy (for now) for Unity:


parent_directory/
	3rdParty/
		"Contains assets from outer source, which usually has a pre-defined structure themselves that should not be tampered with"
	Audio/
		"Contains audio files, background music goes into Music, sound effects go to SFX"
		Music/
		SFX/
	Materials/
		"Self-explanatory, contains the created materials"
	Prefabs/
		"When you export the object into assets for reusability, Unity saves it in terms of prefabs, all prefabs should go here"
	Scenes/
		"Self-explanatory"
	Scripts/
		"Self-explanatory"
	


General rules for using this file hierachy:
	- Unless there's no other way, never store files in the parent_directory, always go in the sub-directory ones
	- Unless it is extremely confusing, don't create sub-directories
	- Naming convention: always CamelCase
	- Maybe possible: If there's something you are not sure about adding, creating a sub-directory called "Sandbox" to test it before officially adding it to the project assets
